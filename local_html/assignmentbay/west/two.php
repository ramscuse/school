            <p>
                Apples and oranges are two popular fruits that are often compared and contrasted. 
                One of the most obvious differences between an apple and an orange is their appearance. 
                Apples are typically round or oval-shaped with a smooth, waxy skin that can range in color from green to yellow to red. 
                On the other hand, oranges are spherical with a bumpy, textured skin that is typically orange in color. 
                The texture of the skin of an orange is also thicker and more porous than that of an apple. When cut open, 
                an apple typically has a white or cream-colored flesh with a dense, crunchy texture, 
                while an orange has a juicy, segmented flesh that is bright orange in color.

                Another major difference between apples and oranges is their taste and nutritional content. 
                Apples are generally sweeter and have a crisp, refreshing taste, while oranges are more tart and tangy with a juicy, 
                citrusy flavor. Apples are also higher in fiber, while oranges are higher in vitamin C. Apples can be eaten raw, cooked, 
                or baked, and are a popular ingredient in many desserts, while oranges are often consumed as a snack or used in juices and 
                smoothies. Overall, while both fruits are delicious and nutritious in their own right, 
                they offer distinct flavor and nutritional profiles that make them unique.
